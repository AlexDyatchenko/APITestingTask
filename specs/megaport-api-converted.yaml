  title: Megaport API Documentation
  description: "Megaport offers a public API for access to all the services available\
    \ through the Megaport Portal. You can use this API to automate your Megaport\
    \ provisioning to save time and effort.\nThe Megaport API is based on REST. The\
    \ API has predictable URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded\
    \ responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.\nIn addition to this reference,\
    \ you can find API tutorials in the Megaport Documentation.\nEnvironments\nThere\
    \ are two server environments that can be accessed using different URLs:\n\nhttps://api.megaport.com\
    \ - this is the live Production environment. You will be liable for any services\
    \ ordered in this system.\n\nhttps://api-staging.megaport.com - this is a test\
    \ Staging environment and is expected to have lower availability requirements.\
    \ You can test any action in this environment and the API calls and responses\
    \ mirror the production system, but the services will not be deployed and you\
    \ will not be billed for any activity. The staging environment is reset (to match\
    \ the production environment) every 24 hours.\n\nYou can use the Environments\
    \ menu in the upper-left corner of this site to toggle the examples between No\
    \ Environment (which shows baseUrl) and Staging (https://api-staging.megaport.com).\n\
    You can define environment variables in your Postman collection to automatically\
    \ populate the baseUrl value in API requests and easily switch between staging\
    \ and production environments.\nFor more information about authenticating users\
    \ in these environments, see Megaport Authentication - API Keys.\nResponses\n\
    All API responses include standard HTTP response codes:\n\n200 - OK. A successful\
    \ request.\n\n400 - Bad request. This error is typically caused by missing or\
    \ incorrect request parameters.\n\n401 - Unauthorized. This error indicates that\
    \ the request is missing the required authentication credentials. Typically this\
    \ means a missing or invalid API access token.\n\n403 - Forbidden. You do not\
    \ have the required permissions to perform this request.\n\n500 - Server error.\
    \ When this occurs, Megaport developers are notified of the error by email by\
    \ the server.\n\n503 - Server is unavailable, possibly down for maintenance.\n\
    \nA standard response to a request will include a message, plus optionally some\
    \ data.\nRelease Notes\nNovember 2025\nDate Fields Added to Employment Endpoint\
    \ Response – The /v2/employee/{employeeId} and /v2/employment endpoint responses\
    \ now include the createDate, lastUpdateDate, and lastLoginDate fields for logged-in\
    \ users and Company Admin users. This allows you to see when each user was created,\
    \ when the account was last modified, and when the account last signed in, which\
    \ improves visibility and audit capabilities for security purposes.\nOctober 2025\n\
    New Endpoint for IPsec Data – A new endpoint GET /v3/products/mcrs/{productUid}/ipsec\
    \ has been created to retrieve IPsec-related data. The endpoint response Body\
    \ includes the following:\n\nMax IPsec tunnel count limit for the MCR.\n\nTotal\
    \ tunnel count - total number of configured tunnels for an MCR.\n\nThe list of\
    \ IPsec configured tunnels with details, including:\n\nVXC name\n\nVXC product\
    \ Uid\n\nVLAN\n\nIPsec tunnels (sourceIpAddress, destinationIpAddress, description)\n\
    \nSeptember 2025\ninvitationPending field added to /v2/employee – Added the invitationPending\
    \ field to the GET /v2/employee endpoint response to improve employee invitation\
    \ status visibility.\nAugust 2025\nCross Connect Ordering – In the networkdesign/validate\
    \ and networkdesign/buy endpoints, the Cross Connect implementation has been updated\
    \ to use the addOn config instead of the crossConnectRequested flag.\nPartner\
    \ Resource Limits – Megaport partners can now configure resource limits for their\
    \ managed companies via the API. The POST and PUT /v2/managedCompanies endpoints\
    \ now accept a new optional field in the request Body called resourceLimits.Example\
    \ structure:\n{  \n...  \n\"resourceLimits\": [  \n{  \n\"productType\": \"MEGAPORT\"\
    ,  \n\"limit\": 10  \n},  \n{  \n\"productType\": \"VXC\",  \n\"limit\": 20  \n\
    }  \n],  \n...  \n}\n\nJune 2025\nChanges for GET /v4/product/mve/images – These\
    \ changes have been made to the response Body of this endpoint:\n\nA new field\
    \ vendorProductId has been added. This is a unique identifier generated by concatenating\
    \ the product and vendor values.\n\nMVE images are now returned with the most\
    \ recent (highest id) being returned first, per product and vendor.\n\nService\
    \ Speed Values in GET /v3/locations – The mcrSpeedMps and megaportSpeedMbps array\
    \ values in the /v3/locations endpoint response are now returned in ascending\
    \ order.\nMay 2025\nGET /v3/locations – The Megaport Portal has been updated to\
    \ use the new /v3/locations API endpoint instead of /v2/locations. The /v2/locations\
    \ public API is now deprecated and will be fully decommissioned on 31 July 2025.\
    \ For more information, see API Deprecation Notices and Frequently Asked Questions\
    \ (FAQs).\nInvoice APIs Updated to V3 – The Megaport Portal has been updated to\
    \ use the new v3 invoice API endpoints instead of v2. Note also that companyId\
    \ has been updated to companyUid, and supplierId has been added to the URL in\
    \ the v3 version. The v2 public APIs are now deprecated and will be fully decommissioned\
    \ on 31 July 2025. For more information, see API Deprecation Notices and Frequently\
    \ Asked Questions (FAQs).\nDisallow Service Deletion when Connected VXCs Exist\
    \ – Previously, deleting a product in the Megaport Terraform Provider, either\
    \ explicitly or due to Port speed changes, could inadvertently delete attached\
    \ VXCs. This caused an issue as the Megaport Terraform Provider was unaware of\
    \ the deletion, which led to unexpected results. Therefore, a query parameter\
    \ safe_delete=true has been added to delete calls in the Megaport Terraform Provider,\
    \ which tells the API to return an error when deleting a product if it has attached\
    \ VXCs. This makes it clear to the user that they need to move the VXC first,\
    \ or delete it independently of their current operation, without causing issues\
    \ to the Terraform state. This does not effect existing API or Portal users.\n\
    April 2025\nJumbo Frame Support on MCR: A new field ipMtu has been added to the\
    \ following endpoints which allows you to set the largest size (in bytes) of an\
    \ IP packet that can be sent over the connected VXC.\n\nPOST /v3/networkdesign/validate\n\
    \nPOST /v3/networkdesign/buy\n\nPUT /v3/product/vxc/{uid}\n\nInvoice Endpoint\
    \ Improvements: The invoicing endpoints have been updated to change the Invoice\
    \ Charge From/To date fields to reflect the time period to which the ETF applies\
    \ - the ETF duration.\nPacket Filtering on MCR Endpoints: New endpoints have been\
    \ created to manage MCR packet filters via the API. New fields have also been\
    \ added to the VXC create/update endpoint data within the interfaces object to\
    \ define packet filters for a VXC (packetFilterIn/ packetFilterOut).\n\nGET MCR\
    \ Packet Filter Details – /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilter/{packetFilterId}\n\
    \nGET MCR Packet Filter Summary List – /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilters\n\
    \nPOST Create MCR Packet Filter – /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilter\n\
    \nPUT Update MCR Packet Filter – /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilter/{packetFilterId}\n\
    \nDEL Delete MCR Packet Filter – /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilter/{packetFilterId}\n\
    \nFixed: The /v2/products endpoint was taking up to 4 minutes to respond for Google\
    \ inc. This has now reduced significantly to around 50 seconds.\nMarch 2025\n\
    Updated GET /v3/locations: These improvements have been made to the /v3/locations\
    \ endpoint:\n\nAdded the optional parameter mveImageId. When including the mveImageId,\
    \ the endpoint will return only the locations that have capacity for the mveImageId.\
    \ If the mveImageId is not passed in, the mveMaxCpuCoreCount value will always\
    \ be null.\n\nAdded the MCR speed field (mcrSpeedMbps).\n\nFebruary 2025\nNew\
    \ /v3/notificationPreferences Endpoint: The /v3/notificationPreferences endpoint\
    \ has been added to allow users to subscribe to individual notifications or notification\
    \ groups in the Megaport Portal. This endpoint replaces the previous /v2/notificationPreferences\
    \ endpoint. For more information, see Email Notifications.\nRemoved the PUT /v2/product/cxc/{productUid}\
    \ Endpoint: The PUT /v2/product/cxc endpoint has been deprecated as all active\
    \ CXC services have been migrated to VXCs. Users should access the PUT /v2/product/vxc/{productUid}\
    \ endpoint instead.\nJanuary 2025\nOracle Virtual Circuit ID Now Returned: Improvements\
    \ have been made to the public APIs relating to Oracle VXCs. The virtualCircuitId\
    \ field (the VLAN ID on the Oracle side of the VXC) is now returned in the response\
    \ for these APIs:\n\nGET /v2/product/{uid}\n\nGET /v2/products\n\nPOST /v3/networkdesign/validate\n\
    \nPOST /v3/networkdesign/buy\n\nDecember 2024\nActivity Logging: Improvements\
    \ have been made to the account activity information that is logged and displayed\
    \ in the Megaport Portal. A new API v3/activity has also been created that can\
    \ be used to retrieve activity logs for the logged-in user.\nNovember 2024\nDeprecate\
    \ v2 APIs Replaced by v3 APIs: As previously communicated, some of our v2 APIs\
    \ have been superseded by v3 versions and were scheduled for deprecation. These\
    \ v2 APIs have now been officially deprecated and no longer supported by Megaport:\n\
    \nGet MVE Price: GET /v2/pricebook/mve\n\nGet VXC Price: GET /v2/pricebook/vxc\n\
    \nValidate Orders: POST /v2/networkdesign/validate\n\nBuy Services: POST /v2/networkdesign/buy\n\
    \nUpdate VXC Details: PUT /v2/product/vxc/{productUid}\n\nDelete Services: POST\
    \ /v2/product/{productUid}/action/{action}\n\nFor more information, see API v2\
    \ Shutdown FAQs.\nUpdated Invoice APIs from v2 to v3: The invoice APIs have been\
    \ to updated from v2 to v3, and to support companyUid.\n\nGET /v3/company/${companyUid}/invoice/supplierId/{supplierId}?fromDate=${fromDate}&amp;toDate=${toDate}\n\
    \nGET /v3/company/${companyUid}/invoice/${invoiceId}\n\nGET /v3/company/${companyUid}/invoice/${invoiceId}/pdf\n\
    \nGET /v3/company/${companyUid}/invoice/${invoiceId}/csv\n\nResource Tags Added\
    \ to Invoice Report: Resource tags for services have been added to the Invoices\
    \ report (CSV only). This allows you to export tagging information for external\
    \ analysis.\nAdded Diversity Zone in Response for CSPs: Previously customers who\
    \ wanted to connect to a CSP were not able to see the diversity zone they were\
    \ connecting to when reviewing available ports. The diversity zone information\
    \ has now been added to the response that is returned so customers can determine\
    \ the diversity zone they are connecting to for a given service. For example,\
    \ the response that is returned in this request will now include diversity zone:\
    \ /v2/secure/google/{pairing_key}.\nOctober 2024\nRemoved MCR BFD Timer Settings:\
    \ Support for maintaining MCR BFD timer settings has been removed from the API.\
    \ The BFD settings are not editable, the default values configured when BFD is\
    \ enabled are Transmit Interval: 300 milliseconds, Receive Interval: 300 milliseconds,\
    \ Multiplier: 3.\nAugust 2024\nResource Tagging: Customers now have the ability\
    \ to create, modify, and delete resource tags to manage their active services\
    \ via the Megaport API. Resource tags are key and value pairs that act as metadata\
    \ for organizing Megaport resources. These tags will appear in the Service Inventory\
    \ report by default for the company who has implemented the tags providing they\
    \ own the service the tag is put against.\nNew Endpoints for MVE: The new endpoints\
    \ GET v3/locations and GET v4/product/mve/images have been added. v3/locations\
    \ and v4/product/mve/images are intended to replace v2/locations and v3/product/mve/images.\
    \ The MVE details have moved to v4/product/mve/images. If the v3/locations diversityZones\
    \ has a value in the mveMaxCpuCoreCount then you can order any MVE from the v4/product/mve/images\
    \ endpoint as long as the size is less than the maxMaxCpuCoreCount.\nAdd Max Length\
    \ Validation to Service Level Reference Field: Validations have been changed for\
    \ the Service Level Reference field (costCentre) so that this field now has a\
    \ maximum value of 255 characters.\nFixed: API was responding with a 400 error\
    \ instead of a 404 when querying a product that doesn’t exist.\nJuly 2024\nTelemetry\
    \ CSV Download: The service telemetry APIs can now download utilization data in\
    \ CSV format as well as text format. For more information, see Metric Types.\n\
    GET /v2/product/{productUid} Speed Improvements: The performance of this API has\
    \ been optimised. In some cases, the load time for this API for larger companies\
    \ has halved.\nJune 2024\nSupport for Monitoring Maintenance and Outage Events:\
    \ The /ens/v1/status/outage and /ens/v1/status/maintenance public APIs have been\
    \ created which allow you to monitor maintenance activities and service outages.\
    \ For more information, see Maintenance and Outage Events.\nFixed: NPE errors\
    \ were occurring in the /v2/employment endpoint because the user did not not have\
    \ an email address defined.\nMay 2024\nMegaport Internet Available in More Countries:\
    \ Megaport Internet connections can now also be ordered from Ports and MCRs in\
    \ New Zealand, Canada, and Singapore, in addition to Australia, UK and the US\
    \ where it was already available.\nApril 2024\nNew /v3/login API: A new /v3/login\
    \ API has been created to replace the soon to be deprecated /v2/login API. The\
    \ v2 API will no longer be supported; please migrate any API integrations you\
    \ have from the v2 version to the new v3 API version.\nGSA/GRA Updated: Megaport\
    \ has updated the standard Global Services Agreement (GSA) and Global Reseller\
    \ Agreement (GRA) terms (in accordance with Clauses 15(a) and 20(a) respectively).\
    \ As part of this update, the early termination fee (ETF) applied to a service\
    \ on a contract that is canceled before the term is complete has changed from\
    \ 50% to 100%. This change took effect in the Megaport Portal on April 15, 2024.\n\
    March 2024\nNew Service Inventory API: A new public API /v2/secure/inventory/companies/{companyUid}/services/csv\
    \ has been created which allows you to download your service inventory, including\
    \ historical services, in comma-separated values (CSV) file format. You can also\
    \ return the service inventory in JSON format using the /v2/secure/inventory/companies/{companyUid}/services\
    \ API. For more information, see Service Inventory Report.\nUpdated GET Available\
    \ MVE Sizes API: The GET Available MVE Sizes /v2/product/mve/variants API has\
    \ been updated to remove the bandwidthMbps parameter from the response.\nMVE validate/buy\
    \ API Changes to Remove Vendor: Changes have been made to the following MVE APIs\
    \ to remove vendor as a required parameter. This parameter is no longer required,\
    \ and if passed it will just be ignored.\n\n/v2/networkdesign/validate\n\n/v3/networkdesign/validate\n\
    \n/v2/networkdesign/buy\n\n/v3/networkdesign/buy\n\nFebruary 2024\nNew Invoice\
    \ APIs: To ensure you keep receiving the most accurate, up-to-date and complete\
    \ invoice data, including credit notes and tax information, you are required to\
    \ migrate to the new invoice API endpoints. For more information, see New Invoice\
    \ APIs FAQs and Invoices.\nMCR and MVE Diversity: You can now choose a diversity\
    \ zone when creating MCRs and MVEs. You can pass the diversityZone parameter when\
    \ validating and ordering an MCR and MVE via API. For more information, see Buy\
    \ MCR (v3) and the Buy MVE (v3) endpoint for the relevant vendor.\nVXC Shutdown\
    \ added to the Create Screen: The VXC and IX shutdown feature has been expanded\
    \ so that you can now shut down a VXC and IX service when creating the service.\
    \ Previously it could be done only when editing the service. You can now pass\
    \ the shutdown parameter in the v2/v3 validate and buy API endpoints. If not passed,\
    \ it defaults to FALSE (Enabled).\nDecember 2023\nTerms on VXC: VXCs can now be\
    \ put on a 12, 24, or 36 month term. The following APIs have been updated to accept\
    \ the new optional field: “term” to put a VXC on term:\n\nPOST /v3/networkdesign/validate\n\
    \nPOST /v3/networkdesign/buy\n\nPUT /v3/product/vxc/{productUid}\n\nAcceptable\
    \ values for “term” are: 1, 12, 24, 36. If “term” is not provided when validating\
    \ and ordering a VXC, it defaults to 1 (No Minimum Term). If “term” is not provided\
    \ when updating a VXC, the existing value is not updated.\nImproved Telemetry\
    \ API: The following enhancements have been made to the Telemetry APIs:\n\nYou\
    \ can now specify a time span in 'days in the past' instead of needing exact dates.\n\
    \nYou can ask for multiple metrics in a single request (for example, bit rate\
    \ + packet rate) to reduce the number of requests needed.  For more information,\
    \ see Metric Types.\n\nAWS HC Fetch Supported Bandwidths: A new public API /v2/secure/awshc\
    \ has been created to look up AWS HC ports with supported bandwidth options.\n\
    November 2023\nVXC / IX Shutdown: Added the shutdown option to VXC/IX validate\
    \ and buy APIs.\nOctober 2023\nReverse DNS for IX Connections: Enabled the ability\
    \ to add and edit reverse DNS for IX connections. Updated the Validate, Buy, and\
    \ Update IX APIs to support the specifying of reverse DNS. For more information,\
    \ see PUT Update IX.\nFixed: The error ‘A Deal with uid [None]’ was showing when\
    \ trying to order a VXC between an MVE and a Port.\nSeptember 2023\nSupport 5x\
    \ vNICs for an MVE:\n\nPOST /v3/networkdesign/validate and POST /v3/networkdesign/buy\
    \ have been updated to accept up to 5 vNICs when ordering an MVE.\n\nGET /v2/product/{productUid}\
    \ and GET /v2/products return vNICs information for an MVE.\n\nUpdated GET Locations\
    \ API to dynamically return the list of port speeds available: The query made\
    \ by the /v2/locations API has been updated to return all three speeds available\
    \ (1G, 10G, and 100G) at a location. For more information, see GET Locations.\n\
    August 2023\nPerformance Improvements: Multiple APIs have been updated for speed\
    \ and performance improvements.\nFrance IX: GET Partner Megaports now returns\
    \ France IX ports that you can connect to. These ports have connectType=FRANCEIX.\
    \ For more information, see GET Partner Megaports.\nMCR Looking Glass Performance\
    \ Improvements: MCR Looking Glass APIs have been updated to support asynchronous\
    \ requests for IP, BGP, and neighbor routes in async mode. A new API called GET\
    \ MCR IP / BGP BGP Neighbor Routes in Async Mode has also been created to support\
    \ retrieving these results. For more information, see MCR Looking Glass.\nJuly\
    \ 2023\nMexico Billing Market: Four new mandatory TAX Registration fields related\
    \ to fiscal and legal compliance information are now required when adding or editing\
    \ the Mexico billing market. These are: Company Type, Tax Regime, Tax Purpose,\
    \ and RFC Number. For more information, see POST Set Billing Market.\nFixed: B-End\
    \ VLAN being overridden by the A-End VLAN in the Service Key VXCs /validate and\
    \ /buy endpoints. After ordering a Service Key VXC from a Port, MCR or MVE with\
    \ a defined B-End VLAN, the service returned a different VLAN value from the one\
    \ sent as part of the payload in both the /validate and /buy APIs. The B-End value\
    \ the API returned for Service Key VXCs was the VLAN value in the A-End. Now the\
    \ B-End VLAN value is returned correctly.\nAPI Deprecation Notices\nFrom time\
    \ to time we update, change versions, and deprecate APIs when releasing new functionality.\n\
    We recommend that you keep up to date with these changes and plan any API integration\
    \ updates accordingly. For more information, see API Deprecation Notices and Frequently\
    \ Asked Questions (FAQs).\nFeedback\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or corrections\

    \ view the list of available Ports. Look for Ports with a connectType of AWS or\

    \ providers, you create the virtual network or circuit in the partner’s portal\
    \ and then generate a service key. The service key will contain the Port details\
    \ for the B-End.\nAfter identifying a B-End details, complete the VXC configuration\
    \ by updating the Body of the request with partner-specific data, such as the\
    \ B-End productUid.\nHere is a sample partnerConfig:\n\"bEnd\": {\n     \"productUid\"\
