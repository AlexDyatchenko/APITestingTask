  title: Megaport API Documentation
  description: "Megaport offers a public API for access to all the services available\
    \ through the Megaport Portal. You can use this API to automate your Megaport\
    \ provisioning to save time and effort.\nThe Megaport API is based on REST. The\
    \ API has predictable URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded\
    \ responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.\nIn addition to this reference,\
    \ you can find API tutorials in the Megaport Documentation.\nEnvironments\nThere\
    \ are two server environments that can be accessed using different URLs:\n\nhttps://api.megaport.com\
    \ - this is the live Production environment. You will be liable for any services\
    \ ordered in this system.\n\nhttps://api-staging.megaport.com - this is a test\
    \ Staging environment and is expected to have lower availability requirements.\
    \ You can test any action in this environment and the API calls and responses\
    \ mirror the production system, but the services will not be deployed and you\
    \ will not be billed for any activity. The staging environment is reset (to match\
    \ the production environment) every 24 hours.\n\nYou can use the Environments\
    \ menu in the upper-left corner of this site to toggle the examples between No\
    \ Environment (which shows baseUrl) and Staging (https://api-staging.megaport.com).\n\
    You can define environment variables in your Postman collection to automatically\
    \ populate the baseUrl value in API requests and easily switch between staging\
    \ and production environments.\nFor more information about authenticating users\
    \ in these environments, see Megaport Authentication - API Keys.\nResponses\n\
    All API responses include standard HTTP response codes:\n\n200 - OK. A successful\
    \ request.\n\n400 - Bad request. This error is typically caused by missing or\
    \ incorrect request parameters.\n\n401 - Unauthorized. This error indicates that\
    \ the request is missing the required authentication credentials. Typically this\
    \ means a missing or invalid API access token.\n\n403 - Forbidden. You do not\
    \ have the required permissions to perform this request.\n\n500 - Server error.\
    \ When this occurs, Megaport developers are notified of the error by email by\
    \ the server.\n\n503 - Server is unavailable, possibly down for maintenance.\n\
    \nA standard response to a request will include a message, plus optionally some\
    \ data.\nRelease Notes\nNovember 2025\nDate Fields Added to Employment Endpoint\
    \ Response \u2013 The /v2/employee/{employeeId} and /v2/employment endpoint responses\
    \ now include the createDate, lastUpdateDate, and lastLoginDate fields for logged-in\
    \ users and Company Admin users. This allows you to see when each user was created,\
    \ when the account was last modified, and when the account last signed in, which\
    \ improves visibility and audit capabilities for security purposes.\nOctober 2025\n\
    New Endpoint for IPsec Data \u2013 A new endpoint GET /v3/products/mcrs/{productUid}/ipsec\
    \ has been created to retrieve IPsec-related data. The endpoint response Body\
    \ includes the following:\n\nMax IPsec tunnel count limit for the MCR.\n\nTotal\
    \ tunnel count - total number of configured tunnels for an MCR.\n\nThe list of\
    \ IPsec configured tunnels with details, including:\n\nVXC name\n\nVXC product\
    \ Uid\n\nVLAN\n\nIPsec tunnels (sourceIpAddress, destinationIpAddress, description)\n\
    \nSeptember 2025\ninvitationPending field added to /v2/employee \u2013 Added the\
    \ invitationPending field to the GET /v2/employee endpoint response to improve\
    \ employee invitation status visibility.\nAugust 2025\nCross Connect Ordering\
    \ \u2013 In the networkdesign/validate and networkdesign/buy endpoints, the Cross\
    \ Connect implementation has been updated to use the addOn config instead of the\
    \ crossConnectRequested flag.\nPartner Resource Limits \u2013 Megaport partners\
    \ can now configure resource limits for their managed companies via the API. The\
    \ POST and PUT /v2/managedCompanies endpoints now accept a new optional field\
    \ in the request Body called resourceLimits.Example structure:\n{  \n...  \n\"\
    resourceLimits\": [  \n{  \n\"productType\": \"MEGAPORT\",  \n\"limit\": 10  \n\
    },  \n{  \n\"productType\": \"VXC\",  \n\"limit\": 20  \n}  \n],  \n...  \n}\n\
    \nJune 2025\nChanges for GET /v4/product/mve/images \u2013 These changes have\
    \ been made to the response Body of this endpoint:\n\nA new field vendorProductId\
    \ has been added. This is a unique identifier generated by concatenating the product\
    \ and vendor values.\n\nMVE images are now returned with the most recent (highest\
    \ id) being returned first, per product and vendor.\n\nService Speed Values in\
    \ GET /v3/locations \u2013 The mcrSpeedMps and megaportSpeedMbps array values\
    \ in the /v3/locations endpoint response are now returned in ascending order.\n\
    May 2025\nGET /v3/locations \u2013 The Megaport Portal has been updated to use\
    \ the new /v3/locations API endpoint instead of /v2/locations. The /v2/locations\
    \ public API is now deprecated and will be fully decommissioned on 31 July 2025.\
    \ For more information, see API Deprecation Notices and Frequently Asked Questions\
    \ (FAQs).\nInvoice APIs Updated to V3 \u2013 The Megaport Portal has been updated\
    \ to use the new v3 invoice API endpoints instead of v2. Note also that companyId\
    \ has been updated to companyUid, and supplierId has been added to the URL in\
    \ the v3 version. The v2 public APIs are now deprecated and will be fully decommissioned\
    \ on 31 July 2025. For more information, see API Deprecation Notices and Frequently\
    \ Asked Questions (FAQs).\nDisallow Service Deletion when Connected VXCs Exist\
    \ \u2013 Previously, deleting a product in the Megaport Terraform Provider, either\
    \ explicitly or due to Port speed changes, could inadvertently delete attached\
    \ VXCs. This caused an issue as the Megaport Terraform Provider was unaware of\
    \ the deletion, which led to unexpected results. Therefore, a query parameter\
    \ safe_delete=true has been added to delete calls in the Megaport Terraform Provider,\
    \ which tells the API to return an error when deleting a product if it has attached\
    \ VXCs. This makes it clear to the user that they need to move the VXC first,\
    \ or delete it independently of their current operation, without causing issues\
    \ to the Terraform state. This does not effect existing API or Portal users.\n\
    April 2025\nJumbo Frame Support on MCR: A new field ipMtu has been added to the\
    \ following endpoints which allows you to set the largest size (in bytes) of an\
    \ IP packet that can be sent over the connected VXC.\n\nPOST /v3/networkdesign/validate\n\
    \nPOST /v3/networkdesign/buy\n\nPUT /v3/product/vxc/{uid}\n\nInvoice Endpoint\
    \ Improvements: The invoicing endpoints have been updated to change the Invoice\
    \ Charge From/To date fields to reflect the time period to which the ETF applies\
    \ - the ETF duration.\nPacket Filtering on MCR Endpoints: New endpoints have been\
    \ created to manage MCR packet filters via the API. New fields have also been\
    \ added to the VXC create/update endpoint data within the interfaces object to\
    \ define packet filters for a VXC (packetFilterIn/ packetFilterOut).\n\nGET MCR\
    \ Packet Filter Details \u2013 /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilter/{packetFilterId}\n\
    \nGET MCR Packet Filter Summary List \u2013 /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilters\n\
    \nPOST Create MCR Packet Filter \u2013 /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilter\n\
    \nPUT Update MCR Packet Filter \u2013 /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilter/{packetFilterId}\n\
    \nDEL Delete MCR Packet Filter \u2013 /v2/product/mcr2/{productUid}/packetFilter/{packetFilterId}\n\
    \nFixed: The /v2/products endpoint was taking up to 4 minutes to respond for Google\
    \ inc. This has now reduced significantly to around 50 seconds.\nMarch 2025\n\
    Updated GET /v3/locations: These improvements have been made to the /v3/locations\
    \ endpoint:\n\nAdded the optional parameter mveImageId. When including the mveImageId,\
    \ the endpoint will return only the locations that have capacity for the mveImageId.\
    \ If the mveImageId is not passed in, the mveMaxCpuCoreCount value will always\
    \ be null.\n\nAdded the MCR speed field (mcrSpeedMbps).\n\nFebruary 2025\nNew\
    \ /v3/notificationPreferences Endpoint: The /v3/notificationPreferences endpoint\
    \ has been added to allow users to subscribe to individual notifications or notification\
    \ groups in the Megaport Portal. This endpoint replaces the previous /v2/notificationPreferences\
    \ endpoint. For more information, see Email Notifications.\nRemoved the PUT /v2/product/cxc/{productUid}\
    \ Endpoint: The PUT /v2/product/cxc endpoint has been deprecated as all active\
    \ CXC services have been migrated to VXCs. Users should access the PUT /v2/product/vxc/{productUid}\
    \ endpoint instead.\nJanuary 2025\nOracle Virtual Circuit ID Now Returned: Improvements\
    \ have been made to the public APIs relating to Oracle VXCs. The virtualCircuitId\
    \ field (the VLAN ID on the Oracle side of the VXC) is now returned in the response\
    \ for these APIs:\n\nGET /v2/product/{uid}\n\nGET /v2/products\n\nPOST /v3/networkdesign/validate\n\
    \nPOST /v3/networkdesign/buy\n\nDecember 2024\nActivity Logging: Improvements\
    \ have been made to the account activity information that is logged and displayed\
    \ in the Megaport Portal. A new API v3/activity has also been created that can\
    \ be used to retrieve activity logs for the logged-in user.\nNovember 2024\nDeprecate\
    \ v2 APIs Replaced by v3 APIs: As previously communicated, some of our v2 APIs\
    \ have been superseded by v3 versions and were scheduled for deprecation. These\
    \ v2 APIs have now been officially deprecated and no longer supported by Megaport:\n\
    \nGet MVE Price: GET /v2/pricebook/mve\n\nGet VXC Price: GET /v2/pricebook/vxc\n\
    \nValidate Orders: POST /v2/networkdesign/validate\n\nBuy Services: POST /v2/networkdesign/buy\n\
    \nUpdate VXC Details: PUT /v2/product/vxc/{productUid}\n\nDelete Services: POST\
    \ /v2/product/{productUid}/action/{action}\n\nFor more information, see API v2\
    \ Shutdown FAQs.\nUpdated Invoice APIs from v2 to v3: The invoice APIs have been\
    \ to updated from v2 to v3, and to support companyUid.\n\nGET /v3/company/${companyUid}/invoice/supplierId/{supplierId}?fromDate=${fromDate}&amp;toDate=${toDate}\n\
    \nGET /v3/company/${companyUid}/invoice/${invoiceId}\n\nGET /v3/company/${companyUid}/invoice/${invoiceId}/pdf\n\
    \nGET /v3/company/${companyUid}/invoice/${invoiceId}/csv\n\nResource Tags Added\
    \ to Invoice Report: Resource tags for services have been added to the Invoices\
    \ report (CSV only). This allows you to export tagging information for external\
    \ analysis.\nAdded Diversity Zone in Response for CSPs: Previously customers who\
    \ wanted to connect to a CSP were not able to see the diversity zone they were\
    \ connecting to when reviewing available ports. The diversity zone information\
    \ has now been added to the response that is returned so customers can determine\
    \ the diversity zone they are connecting to for a given service. For example,\
    \ the response that is returned in this request will now include diversity zone:\
    \ /v2/secure/google/{pairing_key}.\nOctober 2024\nRemoved MCR BFD Timer Settings:\
    \ Support for maintaining MCR BFD timer settings has been removed from the API.\
    \ The BFD settings are not editable, the default values configured when BFD is\
    \ enabled are Transmit Interval: 300 milliseconds, Receive Interval: 300 milliseconds,\
    \ Multiplier: 3.\nAugust 2024\nResource Tagging: Customers now have the ability\
    \ to create, modify, and delete resource tags to manage their active services\
    \ via the Megaport API. Resource tags are key and value pairs that act as metadata\
    \ for organizing Megaport resources. These tags will appear in the Service Inventory\
    \ report by default for the company who has implemented the tags providing they\
    \ own the service the tag is put against.\nNew Endpoints for MVE: The new endpoints\
    \ GET v3/locations and GET v4/product/mve/images have been added. v3/locations\
    \ and v4/product/mve/images are intended to replace v2/locations and v3/product/mve/images.\
    \ The MVE details have moved to v4/product/mve/images. If the v3/locations diversityZones\
    \ has a value in the mveMaxCpuCoreCount then you can order any MVE from the v4/product/mve/images\
    \ endpoint as long as the size is less than the maxMaxCpuCoreCount.\nAdd Max Length\
    \ Validation to Service Level Reference Field: Validations have been changed for\
    \ the Service Level Reference field (costCentre) so that this field now has a\
    \ maximum value of 255 characters.\nFixed: API was responding with a 400 error\
    \ instead of a 404 when querying a product that doesn\u2019t exist.\nJuly 2024\n\
    Telemetry CSV Download: The service telemetry APIs can now download utilization\
    \ data in CSV format as well as text format. For more information, see Metric\
    \ Types.\nGET /v2/product/{productUid} Speed Improvements: The performance of\
    \ this API has been optimised. In some cases, the load time for this API for larger\
    \ companies has halved.\nJune 2024\nSupport for Monitoring Maintenance and Outage\
    \ Events: The /ens/v1/status/outage and /ens/v1/status/maintenance public APIs\
    \ have been created which allow you to monitor maintenance activities and service\
    \ outages. For more information, see Maintenance and Outage Events.\nFixed: NPE\
    \ errors were occurring in the /v2/employment endpoint because the user did not\
    \ not have an email address defined.\nMay 2024\nMegaport Internet Available in\
    \ More Countries: Megaport Internet connections can now also be ordered from Ports\
    \ and MCRs in New Zealand, Canada, and Singapore, in addition to Australia, UK\
    \ and the US where it was already available.\nApril 2024\nNew /v3/login API: A\
    \ new /v3/login API has been created to replace the soon to be deprecated /v2/login\
    \ API. The v2 API will no longer be supported; please migrate any API integrations\
    \ you have from the v2 version to the new v3 API version.\nGSA/GRA Updated: Megaport\
    \ has updated the standard Global Services Agreement (GSA) and Global Reseller\
    \ Agreement (GRA) terms (in accordance with Clauses 15(a) and 20(a) respectively).\
    \ As part of this update, the early termination fee (ETF) applied to a service\
    \ on a contract that is canceled before the term is complete has changed from\
    \ 50% to 100%. This change took effect in the Megaport Portal on April 15, 2024.\n\
    March 2024\nNew Service Inventory API: A new public API /v2/secure/inventory/companies/{companyUid}/services/csv\
    \ has been created which allows you to download your service inventory, including\
    \ historical services, in comma-separated values (CSV) file format. You can also\
    \ return the service inventory in JSON format using the /v2/secure/inventory/companies/{companyUid}/services\
    \ API. For more information, see Service Inventory Report.\nUpdated GET Available\
    \ MVE Sizes API: The GET Available MVE Sizes /v2/product/mve/variants API has\
    \ been updated to remove the bandwidthMbps parameter from the response.\nMVE validate/buy\
    \ API Changes to Remove Vendor: Changes have been made to the following MVE APIs\
    \ to remove vendor as a required parameter. This parameter is no longer required,\
    \ and if passed it will just be ignored.\n\n/v2/networkdesign/validate\n\n/v3/networkdesign/validate\n\
    \n/v2/networkdesign/buy\n\n/v3/networkdesign/buy\n\nFebruary 2024\nNew Invoice\
    \ APIs: To ensure you keep receiving the most accurate, up-to-date and complete\
    \ invoice data, including credit notes and tax information, you are required to\
    \ migrate to the new invoice API endpoints. For more information, see New Invoice\
    \ APIs FAQs and Invoices.\nMCR and MVE Diversity: You can now choose a diversity\
    \ zone when creating MCRs and MVEs. You can pass the diversityZone parameter when\
    \ validating and ordering an MCR and MVE via API. For more information, see Buy\
    \ MCR (v3) and the Buy MVE (v3) endpoint for the relevant vendor.\nVXC Shutdown\
    \ added to the Create Screen: The VXC and IX shutdown feature has been expanded\
    \ so that you can now shut down a VXC and IX service when creating the service.\
    \ Previously it could be done only when editing the service. You can now pass\
    \ the shutdown parameter in the v2/v3 validate and buy API endpoints. If not passed,\
    \ it defaults to FALSE (Enabled).\nDecember 2023\nTerms on VXC: VXCs can now be\
    \ put on a 12, 24, or 36 month term. The following APIs have been updated to accept\
    \ the new optional field: \u201Cterm\u201D to put a VXC on term:\n\nPOST /v3/networkdesign/validate\n\
    \nPOST /v3/networkdesign/buy\n\nPUT /v3/product/vxc/{productUid}\n\nAcceptable\
    \ values for \u201Cterm\u201D are: 1, 12, 24, 36. If \u201Cterm\u201D is not provided\
    \ when validating and ordering a VXC, it defaults to 1 (No Minimum Term). If \u201C\
    term\u201D is not provided when updating a VXC, the existing value is not updated.\n\
    Improved Telemetry API: The following enhancements have been made to the Telemetry\
    \ APIs:\n\nYou can now specify a time span in 'days in the past' instead of needing\
    \ exact dates.\n\nYou can ask for multiple metrics in a single request (for example,\
    \ bit rate + packet rate) to reduce the number of requests needed.  For more information,\
    \ see Metric Types.\n\nAWS HC Fetch Supported Bandwidths: A new public API /v2/secure/awshc\
    \ has been created to look up AWS HC ports with supported bandwidth options.\n\
    November 2023\nVXC / IX Shutdown: Added the shutdown option to VXC/IX validate\
    \ and buy APIs.\nOctober 2023\nReverse DNS for IX Connections: Enabled the ability\
    \ to add and edit reverse DNS for IX connections. Updated the Validate, Buy, and\
    \ Update IX APIs to support the specifying of reverse DNS. For more information,\
    \ see PUT Update IX.\nFixed: The error \u2018A Deal with uid [None]\u2019 was\
    \ showing when trying to order a VXC between an MVE and a Port.\nSeptember 2023\n\
    Support 5x vNICs for an MVE:\n\nPOST /v3/networkdesign/validate and POST /v3/networkdesign/buy\
    \ have been updated to accept up to 5 vNICs when ordering an MVE.\n\nGET /v2/product/{productUid}\
    \ and GET /v2/products return vNICs information for an MVE.\n\nUpdated GET Locations\
    \ API to dynamically return the list of port speeds available: The query made\
    \ by the /v2/locations API has been updated to return all three speeds available\
    \ (1G, 10G, and 100G) at a location. For more information, see GET Locations.\n\
    August 2023\nPerformance Improvements: Multiple APIs have been updated for speed\
    \ and performance improvements.\nFrance IX: GET Partner Megaports now returns\
    \ France IX ports that you can connect to. These ports have connectType=FRANCEIX.\
    \ For more information, see GET Partner Megaports.\nMCR Looking Glass Performance\
    \ Improvements: MCR Looking Glass APIs have been updated to support asynchronous\
    \ requests for IP, BGP, and neighbor routes in async mode. A new API called GET\
    \ MCR IP / BGP BGP Neighbor Routes in Async Mode has also been created to support\
    \ retrieving these results. For more information, see MCR Looking Glass.\nJuly\
    \ 2023\nMexico Billing Market: Four new mandatory TAX Registration fields related\
    \ to fiscal and legal compliance information are now required when adding or editing\
    \ the Mexico billing market. These are: Company Type, Tax Regime, Tax Purpose,\
    \ and RFC Number. For more information, see POST Set Billing Market.\nFixed: B-End\
    \ VLAN being overridden by the A-End VLAN in the Service Key VXCs /validate and\
    \ /buy endpoints. After ordering a Service Key VXC from a Port, MCR or MVE with\
    \ a defined B-End VLAN, the service returned a different VLAN value from the one\
    \ sent as part of the payload in both the /validate and /buy APIs. The B-End value\
    \ the API returned for Service Key VXCs was the VLAN value in the A-End. Now the\
    \ B-End VLAN value is returned correctly.\nAPI Deprecation Notices\nFrom time\
    \ to time we update, change versions, and deprecate APIs when releasing new functionality.\n\
    We recommend that you keep up to date with these changes and plan any API integration\
    \ updates accordingly. For more information, see API Deprecation Notices and Frequently\

    The validate and buy endpoints use a custom payload to support MVE and provide
    the vendor details. (The validate and the buy requests use the same payload, but
    have different responses.)

    The payload accepts an array of objects, so you can create more than one MVE at
