let's work with this test.
I want to have 20 tests for that endpoint. Create a folder. spread within files with no more than 100 lines.
take as an example `v2.locations.spec.ts` test file.
create ajv schema, Create separate folder for them best practice - we will have a lot of them so build proper folder structure.


"tests/api/megaport-virtual-edge-mve/v2-product-mve-productUid"
all test in this folder.
Dedicate work with ajv to a separate class.


1. move mveSchema as a constructor parameter.
    const validator = new SchemaValidator();
    const validateSchema = validator.compile(mveSchema);

2. move this to the api class into getBody method. ajvSchema must be as an api class property and method setAjvSchema()
          const valid = validateSchema(body);
          expect(valid, JSON.stringify(validateSchema.errors)).toBeTruthy();


3. Hold the map array of compiled schemas for speed optimization and key - is the path to the file.
