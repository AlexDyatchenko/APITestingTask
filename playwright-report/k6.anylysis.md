Analysis of K6 Load Test Results (Last 30 Minutes)
Based on the InfluxDB data, here's a comprehensive analysis of your load testing results:

📊 Test Overview
Test Type: Spike Test (primary test executed)
Total Requests: 41,817 requests
Test Duration: ~22-23 minutes
Virtual Users: Average 102 VUs, peaked at 300 VUs (during spike)
⚠️ Critical Issues Identified

1. High Failure Rate (82.8%)

Failed Requests: 34,611 out of 41,817
Success Rate: Only 17.2%
This indicates severe API instability or access issues 2. HTTP Status Code Distribution

403 Forbidden: 27,618 requests (66% of total)
200 OK: 7,206 requests (17% of total)
Other errors: ~6,993 requests (16%)
The dominant 403 errors suggest authentication/authorization failures. Looking at the sample data, the error_code 1403 appears consistently with expected_response=false, indicating the API is rejecting most requests.

⏱️ Performance Metrics
Response Times:

Mean: 131.96 ms
Min: -390.31 ms (anomaly - likely measurement error)
Max: 9,479.63 ms (~9.5 seconds)
95th Percentile (P95): 434.33 ms
99th Percentile (P99): 825.19 ms
The response times show significant variability, with outliers reaching 9.5 seconds, indicating:

Performance degradation under spike load
Possible rate limiting or throttling
Server-side processing issues
🌍 Test Coverage
Requests were distributed across multiple global metros:

London, Chicago, Mumbai, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Sydney, Singapore, Toronto, Amsterdam, New York, Hong Kong, Paris, Dallas, Melbourne, São Paulo
Both Active and Inactive location statuses were tested.

🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The 66% 403 Forbidden rate is the primary concern. Possible causes:

Missing/Invalid API Authentication: The API key or token might be missing, expired, or invalid
Rate Limiting: The spike test (300 VUs) may have exceeded API rate limits
IP Blocking: Too many requests from the same source triggered protection mechanisms
Incorrect Permissions: The credentials don't have access to query location data
💡 Recommendations
Immediate: Check API authentication configuration in your k6 test scripts
Verify: API credentials are valid and have proper permissions
Review: API rate limits and adjust test parameters accordingly
Investigate: Check with the API provider about the 403 errors
Retest: Run a smoke test with known-good credentials to establish a baseline
The test successfully demonstrated the system's behavior under spike load, but the high error rate indicates configuration or access issues that need to be resolved before meaningful performance analysis can be conducted.
